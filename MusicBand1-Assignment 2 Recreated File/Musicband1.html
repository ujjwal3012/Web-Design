       	Original members Adam Levine, Jesse Carmichael, Mickey Madden and drummer Ryan Dusick first came together as Kara's Flowers in 1994, while they were still in high school. The band self-released an album called We Like Digging?, then signed to Reprise Records and released the album The Fourth World in 1997. After the album garnered a tepid response, the band parted ways with the record label and the members attended college.
